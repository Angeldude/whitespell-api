# Peak Java API
The Peak Java API is an internal Whitespell API for Peak. It is a scalable Java API based 
on Jetty, a library for web servers in Java. We've used Jetty to create an
amazing multi-threaded API. The API consists of a core (with a routing system) and it is super easy to create your own endpoints.
Please contact Pim before making modifications to the API.
